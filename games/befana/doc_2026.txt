BEFANA VS BALLOONS


In Italian folklore and folk customs, the Befana is a witch-like old woman who delivers gifts to children 
throughout Italy on Epiphany Eve (the night of January 5).


Gameplay:

You control Befana. The goal of the game is to destroy or avoid the balloons and take as many gift boxes as possible.
Each gift box improves your fire power. Missing a gift box reduces your energy (see heart icon in the top right corner).
You die when your energy is depleted or if a balloon hits you. 
You can protect yourself by catching the armor item. 

The game has 30 levels and it ends after completing the 30th level.


Disclaimer:

Most of the sprites have been taken from several obvious sources (e.g., Cauldron for Befana, the C64 manual for the balloons).
